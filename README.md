Using the Command Line

The 'processInput()' function acts as the intermediary between users and the core functionalities of the application. It's responsible for interpreting the commands entered by users through the command-line interface. Essentially, it decodes what users want to do and translates those instructions into actions within the application. It essentially acts as the bridge, ensuring a smooth interaction between what the user wants and what the application can do.
